Ratio Project Kickoffs
=
The project kickoff meeting is designed to connect the client with the team, communicate how we intend to deliver the project, and determine the current state of requirements (and develop a plan to complete them). The team for this meeting generally would include PM, CRUX Lead, Engineering Lead, Product Strategy. It could also include Architect, other roles as needed.

### Agenda Topics Overview

#### Client Overview
+ This should be a presentation about the partner from the voice of the AM and/or ES.
+ Goal of this presentation is to communicate:
  + Who the client and its key stakeholders are. (Should include details about the company; core business overview, annual revenue, locations, any info that helps the team understand the client)
  + What is the primary benefit the client will gain through the success of this project? (Goal is to be as specific as possible & authentic)
  + Why did the client select us? (Again specific and authentic)

#### Roles & Responsibilities

+ This is as much a conversation to get to clarity as communication to specific role.
+ Goals:
  + The primary goal is to make sure everyone in the room understands their and the teams role. If they are a Lead and the project calls for additional resources below them (but are not present) the Lead will describe the role they intend for those resources.
  + The secondary goal is to formalize how each person will communicate their role in the client K/O.

#### Tools & Rhythms
+ The PM and AM should have already aligned on planned toolsets with the client in advance of the internal K/O. The PM should have already reviewed attendee calendars and have some regular meeting proposals for the team.
+ Goals:
  + Align as a team about all of the tools the team will be using. (This should include project tools, internal communication tools, source code repo, build management, doc and creative asset storage)
  + Establish standup, sprint planning/retrospective, and client meeting cadence and align on best days/times for the team. Identify any time off/holidays to plan around.

#### Definition of Success & Commitments

+ This conversation starts with the AM and/or ES to present what success looks like for the client and Ratio from a business Perspective. Then each member of the team will identify what the definition of success is for them.

+ The expectation is that each member comes prepared with success metrics in mind and finalizes their list in the session. This list will be reviewed as a part of each sprint retrospective.

+ The team will align on its commitments to the project (this will include commitments on meetings, time entry, jira management, etc)

#### Contract & Initial Project Plan Review 
+ Each team member should review the SOW before the meeting. The key details (promises) will be reviewed and the team will be given a chance to ask questions to ensure they understand the terms.

+ The PM will walk the team through the initial project plan including the current view of hours in projector.

+ The PM will present the buckets of hours for each group in the plan (PM, PS, ENG, CRUX, QA)

#### Client Kick-off Prep

+ Conversation about the goals of the K/O with the client. Review with team the proposed agenda for the client kickoff meeting. Adjust agenda if team finds gaps. Review individual commitments during the client kickoff or to prepare for it.


Client Kickoff Agenda
-
### Three Goals
+ Connect the client to key project team members
  + Build a sense of connection.
  + Let the client know who will be communicating with them and how.
+ Communicate our process
  + "This is how we will deliver for you."
  + Sprints, sprint planning, sprint demos, how the backlog works, reports, etc.
  + Review the PLC overview, cadence of meetings, roles (especially product owner / proxy roles), and ask for questions / comments.
+ Clarify the current state of requirements and the plan to get to sprint one.
  + Review all the data and requirements we have been given.
  + Clarify / ask questions.
  + Identify whether we have enough to begin sprint planning or more work is needed.
  + If more work is needed, agree on a plan to get enough of a backlog together for the first sprint.

### Participants: Core Project Team plus key client stakeholders.
+ Should include: AM, PM, PS, QA, Lead Dev and/or Lead CRUX.
+ Can include: ES, remaining Engineering and/or CRUX and/or QA team members.
  + It's good to think through the team size for this meeting - only schedule the team you actually need to make communication easier.

### Agenda Topics:
*(see Agenda Topics Overview for details)*
+ Team Intros
+ Project overview
+ Client Business Goals
+ Definition of Success
+ Initial Project Plan Review
+ Roles and Responsibilities
+ Tools/Rhythms
+ Next steps
  
### Agenda Topics Overview
#### Project Overview
+ Client presents the scope and overview of the project. All team members who have knowledge of this can contribute to the conversation. However, it is not the point of this to go into depth on any feature.

#### Definition of Success
+ This conversation starts with the Client presenting the definition of a successful project. PM/ AM/EM should work with the client in advance to make sure they have a list of at least 3 success criteria. The client should be able to finish this sentence, “this project will be successful if…”

### Initial Project Plan and Risk Review
+ PM presents high level scope, schedule and budget for the project. This should include any known milestones and store submission strategies (if known). This might also include a list of things still to be decided.
+ The PM will walk the team through the initial project plan, include design activities and sprint rhythms.
+ PM/Tech/Creative Lead should present any major risks involved in the project, and the approach for mitigating them.

#### Roles & Responsibilities
+ Review roles and responsibilities of key team members on Ratio and Client teams.
+ Goals:
  + The primary goal is to make sure everyone in the room understands their role and the client teams member’s roles. Both teams should understand how we are going to work together with the client to get the project done.

#### Tools & Rhythms
+ Present to the client the sprint rhythms and project cadence and tools overview. Ideally the PM would already know if the client has a strong desire to use their own tools rather than ours.
+ Goals:
  + Align as a team about all of the tools the team will be using. (This should include project tools, internal communication tools, source code repo, build management, doc and creative asset storage)
  + Review standup, sprint planning/retrospective, and client meeting cadence and align on best days/times for the team. Identify any time off/holidays to plan around.
